			<h2><em>War Moans</em> by Mutoid Man</h2>	
			<h3>Album Review By Joseph Faria</h3>			
				<p class="review-p"> <img class="covers" src="images/war_moans.jpg" alt="War Moans by Mutoid Man">
					With their second attempt, Mutoid Man has managed to produce a studio album with a great deal of consistency, both relative to their first album,   <em>Bleeder</em>, and as proof they can maintain their intense level of energy between outings. <em>War Moans</em> brings the same easy to enjoy, hard to define, punk-post-alt-core-something or other stylings as Bleeder, but now with a common theme tying all their songs together. Whereas Bleeder’s theme seemed to be <q>words that sound like they’d be songs,</q> <em>War Moans</em> seems focused on relationships, specifically dangerous and ultimately damaging dalliances.

			<h2><em>Lost Ghosts</em> by Red Scalp</h2>	
			<h3>Album Review By Joseph Faria</h3>			
				<p class="review-p"> <img class="covers" src="images/lost_ghosts.jpg" alt="Lost Ghosts by Red Scalp">
					Red Scalp is what you would get if Black Sabbath decided to have a native american theme throughout their music.
					This new album features five new tracks all with ominous themes of the supernatural and nature. This album is a
					wild ride from start to finish. Heavy guitar riffs, native american chanting, as well as saxophone solos are 
					prominent on the album.
