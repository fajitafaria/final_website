				<p>
					With their second attempt, Mutoid Man has managed to produce a studio album with a great deal of consistency, both relative to their first album,   <em>Bleeder</em>, and as proof they can maintain their intense level of energy between outings. <em>War Moans</em> brings the same easy to enjoy, hard to define, punk-post-alt-core-something or other stylings as Bleeder, but now with a common theme tying all their songs together. Whereas Bleeder’s theme seemed to be <q>words that sound like they’d be songs,</q> <em>War Moans</em> seems focused on relationships, specifically dangerous and ultimately damaging dalliances.
				</p>

				<p>
	  				<q>Like lovers in chains / bored with their lives today / we’re getting restless / oh what a god damned shame / but what can you say?</q> That’s from <cite>Bone Chain.</cite>> I didn’t say all of these were subtle, but that thematic throughline in the lyrics definitely makes this feel more like an album with intention rather than a collection of songs. Not that there’s anything wrong with Bleeder’s approach. You can put as much narrative as you want in an album but ultimately it comes down to which songs stimulate, agitate or produce some kind of a reaction, all of which Mutoid Man do with every moment of these songs.

					There’s nothing wasted in this album. There’s no bloated introduction or meandering solos. Every song on this album is under five minutes, a lot are under three, so we waste no time waiting for songs to get going. They are going. They’ve been going. You were one who got there late and now the song is looking at you while you get to your seat. And yet, all of these songs are pleasant to listen to. All the riffs and the rhythms and Brodsky’s vocals are aggressive, but their on your side. They’re not abrasive unless the band wants them to be, like when a song changes tempo halfway through or a word gets held just long enough that what you were expecting and what actually happened have to collide.

					<em>War Moans</em> is refreshingly simple when it comes to how the album operates, but still has enough complexity in each individual song to keep you engaged if you’re listening straight through. Tracks to listen for, aside from all of them, include <cite>Open Flame</cite>, <cite>Kiss of Death</cite>, <cite>Melt Your Mind</cite> and <cite>Bandages</cite>.
