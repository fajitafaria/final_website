			<p>Don't let their look fool you, Ghost is a great band. Ghost is a Swedish heavy metal band that was
			formed in Link√∂ping, Sweden in 2006. They're known for theatric live performances and a Satanic theme. 
			They have an intimidating presence, but are actually much more charming than they look. Their music sounds 
			like Scooby-Doo music, but with sinister lyrics. They have a great gimmick and are becoming one of my all-time
			favorite bands.
			</p>
			<p>The band is led by Papa Emeritus (which is basically the Anti-Pope). Papa is their leader, as well 
			as the lead vocalist of the band. The band has 3 incarnations of Papa Emeritus, Papa I, Papa II, and Papa III. They 
			claim to be different people, but in reality, it's one guy. Following Papa, is the Nameless Ghouls who all play instruments
			in the band. There is a certain mystique to the band, because they choose to keep their identities a secret. 
			</p>
			<p>Ghost currently has currently 3 albums and 2 EP's released. They are; <cite>Opus Eponymous</cite>, <cite>Infestissumam</cite>,
			 <cite>Meliora</cite>, <cite>If You Have Ghosts</cite>, and <cite>Popestar</cite>. Ghost even won a Grammy in 2016 for 
			 <q>Best Metal Performance</q> for their song, <cite>Cirice</cite>. Ghost is band that should not be overlooked for their 
			 gimmick. They actually have great music and they put on a great live performance. For newcomers to the band I recommend 
			 checking out the songs; <cite>Square Hammer</cite>, <cite>Idolatrine</cite>, <cite>Cirice</cite>, and <cite>Ritual</cite>.
