		<h2>Lost Ghosts by Red Scalp</h2>
		<h3>Album Review by Joseph Faria</h3>

				<p>
					Red Scalp is what you would get if Black Sabbath decided to have a native american theme throughout their music.
					This new album features five new tracks all with ominous themes of the supernatural and nature. This album is a
					wild ride from start to finish. Heavy guitar riffs, native american chanting, as well as saxophone solos are 
					prominent on the album. 
				</p>		

				<p> 
					The album starts off with <cite>Portal</cite>, a slow-building heavy song that builds tension til it leads into the
					next song. The next song <cite>Faces</cite>. The heavy sounding guitar carries this song with decent vocals throwned in.
					My favorite song on the album was <cite>Mantra Bufala</cite>. The song features Native-American chants alongside a 
					great guitar riff. Easily the best song on the album.
				</p>

				<p> 
					This album only featured 5 songs, but Red Scalp managed to deliver in the meantime. There was no second wasted on this album.
					I only recently discovered Red Scalp by stumbling on to them through You-tube. This album was certainly a good introduction
					to the band and I look forward to hear more of the music in the future.
				</p>
				<p class="rating">Final Rating: <u>3/5</u></p>
