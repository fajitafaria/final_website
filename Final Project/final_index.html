					<p>Don't let their look fool you, Ghost is a great band. Ghost is a Swedish heavy metal band that was
					 formed in Link√∂ping, Sweden in 2006. They're known for theatric live performances and a Satanic theme. 
					 They have an intimidating presence, but are actually much more charming than they look. Their music sounds 
					 like Scooby-Doo music, but with sinister lyrics. They have a great gimmick and are becoming one of my all-time
					 favorite bands. The band is led by Papa Emeritus (which is basically the Anti-Pope).
